If your browser is set to not accept any cookies, you will not be able to use the Netflix service or website.",Privacy Statement,23363,18067,"Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services.
They are widely used to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information and assist with service or advertising personalization.</p>
 Cookies are not the only types of technology that enable this functionality.
we also use other, similar types of technologies.
See below for more information and examples.</p>
 
 
<strong>What are advertising identifiers?</strong>
 Advertising identifiers are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the ""Identifier for Advertisers"" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the ""Google Advertising ID"" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.
Like cookies, advertising identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant.</p>
 
 
<strong>Why does Netflix use cookies and advertising identifiers?</strong>
 
 
<strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service.
For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them.
They also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service. 
 
<strong>Performance and functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience with Netflix.
For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up).
We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our visitors' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research.
Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service. 
 
<strong>Advertising cookies and advertising identifiers:</strong> These cookies and advertising identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you.
These types of ads are called ""interest-based advertising."" Many of the advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers. 
</ul>
 
 
<strong>How can I exercise choice regarding cookies and advertising identifiers?</strong>
 For more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, click here.</p>
 To opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with an advertising identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under ""privacy"" or ""ads"" in your device's settings).
You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests.</p>

improve our services We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us.
And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.</p>Develop new services We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones.
For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.</p>Provide personalized services, including content and ads We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results.
For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products.
And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.</p>
 Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests.
For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google.
You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.</p>
 
 We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. 
 We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to.
For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop. 
</ul>
 Go to Ad Settings</p>Measure performance We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used.
For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design.
And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns.
We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics.
When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.</p>Communicate with you We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly.
For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location.
Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services.
And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.</p>Protect Google, our users, and the public We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services.
This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.</p>
 We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes.
We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services.
And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content.
We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data.
For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.</p>
 We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above.
For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products.
Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.</p>
 If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo.
This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p>
 We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p>",['http://www.thingiverse.com/'],User information,your data is used for many purposes,bad,,3,

2008,True,,microsoft-store,Binding arbitration and class action waiver,Binding arbitration and class action waiver,,,,"ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES. This Section 26.1 applies to any dispute EXCEPT THAT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE A DISPUTE RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR, MICROSOFT’S, OR EITHER OF OUR LICENSOR’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. “Dispute” means any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and Microsoft concerning the Microsoft Store, the Services, this Contract, or any product or service offered, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. ""Dispute"" will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.
Notice of Dispute. In the event of a dispute, you or Microsoft must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: LCA ARBITRATION, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399. A form is available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=245499. Microsoft will send any Notice of Dispute to you by U.S. Mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your e-mail address. You and Microsoft will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After 60 days, you or Microsoft may commence arbitration.
Small Claims Court. You may also litigate any dispute in small claims court in your county of residence or King County, Washington, if the dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. You may litigate in small claims court whether or not you negotiated informally first.
Binding Arbitration. IF YOU AND MICROSOFT DO NOT RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY INFORMAL NEGOTIATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, ANY OTHER EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE WILL BE CONDUCTED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.
Class Action Waiver. ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER YOU NOR MICROSOFT WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.
Arbitration Procedure, Costs and Fees. Any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and in many cases its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. For more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. In a dispute involving $75,000 or less, Microsoft will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees. You and Microsoft agree to the terms governing procedures, fees, and incentives at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=279535. To commence arbitration, submit the form available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=245497 to the AAA. You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in King County, Washington. Microsoft agrees to commence arbitration only in your county of residence.
Claims or Disputes Must Be Filed Within One Year. To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute relating to the Microsoft Store, the Services, this Contract, or any product or service offered must be filed within one year in small claims court (Section 26.1.2), an arbitration proceeding (Section 26.1.3), or in court, if Section 26.1 permits the dispute to be filed in court instead of arbitration. The one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed. If a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.
Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes. You may reject any change Microsoft makes to Section 26.1 (other than address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in Section 26.1.1. If you do, the most recent version of Section 26.1 before the change you rejected will apply.
Severability. If the class action waiver in Section 26.1.4 is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then Section 26.1 will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of Section 26.1 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of Section 26.1 remaining in full force and effect.",,Waiving your right,Waive class action right,,,,https://groups.google.com/forum#!topic/tosdr/Pr9PDRftSNQ

For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California.
Discord and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the “JAMS Rules”) and under the rules set forth in these Terms.
If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern.
ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state’s law.</p>
  To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Discord will pay the additional cost.
Discord shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous.
You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless Discord is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.
The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Discord and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.
Discord and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration.
The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney’s fees.
Discord and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Discord and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
Discord and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
  If Discord’s or your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator.
You or Discord may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Discord otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.
However, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to still provide Discord with advance notice by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S.

We will only use personal information for our purposes in a manner permitted by relevant data protection legislation.</p>
 
<strong>Cookie Policy</strong>
</p>
 We use cookies to improve your experience on our site, Virgin.com, and to recommend content that may be of interest to you.
You can find out more below about what cookies are, the cookies we use and how to switch them off.</p>
 You can indicate your acceptance to our use of cookies in accordance with this policy by clicking “OK” in the appropriate place on the banner that appears on Virgin.com.
However, please note that if you do not click “OK” but continue to browse the site, you will be deemed to have accepted our use of cookies (and what we use them for) in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
 
<strong>What are cookies?</strong>
</p>
 A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access a website.
The text file is then sent back to our server each time your browser requests a page from the server.
This enables us to operate the site more effectively and load the site so that it reflects your personal preferences, based on your previous browsing on Virgin.com as well as keywords we may be able to gather from URLs of other webpages from which you accessed Virgin.com.
Cookies can also allow us to do various other things, as explained below.</p>
 
<strong>What cookies do we use?</strong>
</p>
 When you visit Virgin.com, the following types of cookies may be downloaded to your device:</p>
 
<strong>Analytical and Performance Cookies</strong>
</p>
 We may use analytics service providers for website traffic analysis and reporting.
Analytics service providers generate statistical and other information about the use of Virgin.com by using cookies.
They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how often visitors return to the site, how long they stay and how visitors move around our site when they are using it.
This helps us to improve the way our site works, for example, it helps users to find what they are looking for easily.
The information generated relating to the site may be used to create reports about the use of the site and the analytics service provider will store this information.</p>
 
<strong>Advertising and Targeting Cookies</strong>
</p>
 These cookies record your visit to Virgin.com, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed to other sites.
We will use this information to try and make our site and other sites that you visit more relevant to your interests.
We may also share this information with others, such as other Virgin companies and carefully selected third parties, for this purpose.</p>
 We work with technology partners to support our website and to provide you with relevant information about the products and services of other Virgin companies both on Virgin.com and on affiliated sites or sites within the advertising networks we work with.
We may use cookies on our site to help us to place relevant Virgin company advertising on third party websites when you visit those sites.
If you are not happy for us to do this, please see the section of this policy titled “How do I turn cookies off?” below.</p>
 
<strong>Functionality Cookies</strong>
</p>
 We may use functional cookies that allow us to remember choices you have made on the site so as to provide you with a more enhanced user experience by delivering content specific to your interests.</p>
 
<strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong>
</p>
 These are cookies that are required for the administration and operation of our site.
Some cookies that we use are necessary for our site to function properly and to enable you to move around the site and use its features.</p>
 
<strong>Third Party Cookies</strong>
</p>
 Because Virgin and Richard have a strong presence on various social networks, we try and make it as easy as possible to share content and to see what content is popular on those networks.
We add buttons to allow people to easily share to those networks.
We also use Facebook to power the commenting functionality on the site.
When we include these social 'plugins', it gives those sites the flexibility to use their own cookies.
They can't read any cookies we set from Virgin.com, and we can't read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of Virgin.com, and it also lets them know whether you're logged into their site.
For example, if you're logged in to Facebook, read a post by Richard Branson and want to make a comment, you can do that straight away without having to log in again - we never know whether you're logged in or not, as you communicate directly with Facebook, through their plugins on our site.</p>
 Other sites and services (including, for example, advertising networks, providers of external services like web traffic analysis services and content recommendation engines) may also use cookies, over which we have no control.
These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.</p>
